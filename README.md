# Description
A tool to identify which of the file changes between 2 sapphire diffs are relevant in a given client's overlays.

# Usage
Currently you need to run the overlayIntersectDiscoverer.js file manually with:

`node apps/overlayIntersectDiscoverer/index.js`

I intend of course to have this work with npm run as soon as possible
